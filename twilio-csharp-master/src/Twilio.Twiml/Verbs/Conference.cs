    /// Much like how the &lt;Number&gt; noun allows you to connect to another phone 
    /// number, the &lt;Conference&gt; noun allows you to connect to a named conference
    /// room and talk with the other callers who have also connected to that room.  
    /// The name of the room is up to you and is namespaced to your account. This means 
    /// that any caller who joins 'room1234' via your account will end up in the same 
    /// conference room, but callers connecting through different accounts would not. 
    /// The maximum number of participants in a single Twilio conference room is 40.  
    /// By default, Twilio conference rooms enable a number of useful features used by 
    /// business conference bridges:
    /// Conferences do not start until at least two participants join.
    /// While waiting, customizable background music is played.
    /// When participants join and leave, notification sounds are played to inform the other 
    /// participants.
    /// You can configure or disable each of these features based on your particular needs.
